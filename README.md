This is an example of code used to create a simple R Shiny app. 

In this case, the code allows the user to upload a CSV file with their data, and create a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). 

There are various options, including adding lines for thresholds, changing the style of the lines, altering the text on  the X-axis and adding or removing the legend.
